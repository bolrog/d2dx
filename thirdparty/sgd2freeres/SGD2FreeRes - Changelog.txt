- Fix the aspect ratio window scaling when the maximize button is
  pressed. Previously, the maximize button only scaled for 4:3 aspect
  ratio even when the resolution's aspect ratio was different.

  pressed. Previously, the button would prevent re-maximizing the
  game window when pressed.

  assertion "nIndex != INVALID_HARDWARE". It is currently unknown how
  to consistently replicate the error.

  to consistently replicate the error.
